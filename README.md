Our mission is to help support wellness for kiwis during pandemic lockdowns.

As kiwi’s in lockdown we’ve all felt the struggles with routine disruption, loneliness and a lack of motivation.

**Lockdown buddy is here to help.**

A group of passionate Kiwis looking to help our communities and friends through lockdown! (and help ourselves ;)

We had a very interesting design process using agile methodologies and **built the app in a weekend** which was an awesome experience.

We hope to see this app grow in future! We see a lot of flexibility and room to grow, both refining the UI and adding new features such as reminders and more customizable recommendations for users! Implementing API's and NZ datasets further is another key aim for us!
